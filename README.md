# Dotfiles

The configuration files for some of the software tools I use on my private
(Ubuntu MATE) machine.

Generally speaking, there isn't too much in here. If a dotfile is more than 100
lines long, it was most likely auto-generated. Regardless, it's kind of nice to
have everything under version control.

## Installation

We need [dotbot] to set everything up.
